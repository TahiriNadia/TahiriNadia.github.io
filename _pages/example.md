## Exploring the patterns of evolution of Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases
*Horizontal gene transfer and recombination are widespread reticulate evolutionary processes contributing to the diversity of bacteria and viruses, allowing them to overcome selective pressure and to adapt to new environments.*

The aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (AARSs) are enzymes that attach the appropriate amino acids onto its cognate transfer RNA. The structure-function aspect of AARSs has long fascinated biologists. The central role played by the AARSs in translation suggests that their histories are somehow intertwined. The novel domain additions to AARSs genes play an important role in the inference of the Tree of Life. The evolution of each of these AARSs can be represented by its own phylogenetic tree (see the celebrated work on this topic by Woese et al. 2000). The cluster analysis of these trees can tell us how many different evolutionary scenarios characterize the evolution of AARSs.

We propose to carry out the supertree clustering analysis of individual AARSs trees by considering the case of the evolution of 20 original AARSs trees from Woese et al. (2000). Our dataset will include 61 species considered by Woese et al. (12 archaebacteria, 12 eukaryotes, and 37 bacteria) as well as additional species, whose AARS sequences have been made available in GenBank.

Moreover, we will conduct a detailed horizontal gene transfer (HGT) and recombination analysis of the obtained supertrees (these supertrees will be inferred from the tree clusters provided by our tree clustering program) in order to identify the main HGT and recombination patterns characterizing the evolution of AARSs. 

Horizontal gene transfer and recombination are widespread reticulate evolutionary processes contributing to the diversity of bacteria and viruses, allowing them to overcome selective pressure and to adapt to new environments. Therefore, developing such approach will help us to understand the impact of selective pressure on the evolution of genetic material.
