# Open positions

**Note: We currently don't have funding for additional PhD and postdoc positions. We can only welcome you if you have a fellowship. I'd be happy to support you after you apply to our group.**

We are always looking for new group members with passion, talent, and grit!

You will have the chance to work on computer science, biology, machine learning, and visualization. You will be involved in determining the important and interesting questions, creating and improving instrumental setups, performing measurements, and making discoveries.
