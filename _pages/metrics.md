## [Comparison of phylogenetic trees defined on different but mutually overlapping sets of taxa]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/metrics)

*Development of distance metrics for comparing phylogenetic trees defined on different but mutually overlapping sets of taxa, in the context of supertrees.*
   
Comparing phylogenetic trees is a prominent problem widely used in applications such as clustering and building the Tree of Life. While there are many well-developed distance measures for phylogenetic trees defined on the same set of taxa, the situation is contrasting for trees defined on different but mutually overlapping sets of taxa. This research project presents a new polynomial-time algorithm for completing phylogenetic trees and computing the distance between trees defined on different but overlapping sets of taxa. This novel approach considers both the branch lengths and the topology of the phylogenetic trees being compared.
