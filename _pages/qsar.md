## Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) Modeling
*The increasing diversity of environmental chemicals in the environment, some of which may be developmental toxicants, is a public health concern.*
The increasing diversity of environmental chemicals in the environment, some of which may be developmental toxicants, is a public health concern. The aim of this work was to contribute to the development of rapid and effective methods to assess prenatal exposure. Quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) modeling has emerged as a promising method in the development of a predictive model for the placental transfer of contaminants. Fetal to maternal plasma or serum concentration ratios for 105 chemicals were extracted from the literature, and 214 molecular descriptors were generated for each of these chemicals. Ten predictive models were built using Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) software, and the Python and R programming languages. Training and test datasets were used, respectively, to build and validate the models. The Applicability Domain Tool v1.0 was used to determine the applicability domain. The models developed with the partial least squares regression method in MOE and SuperLearner in R, showed the best precision and predictivity, with internal coefficients of determination (R<sup>2</sup>) of 0.88 and 0.82, cross-validated R<sup>2</sup><sub>s</sub> of 0.72 and 0.57, and external R<sup>2</sup><sub>s</sub> of 0.73 and 0.74, respectively. The inclusion of all test chemicals by the domain of applicability demonstrated the reliability and relevance of the model predictions. The results obtained demonstrate that QSAR modeling can help quantify placental transfer of environmental chemicals.
